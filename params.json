Sometimes itâ€™s about finding support through life transitions, exploring family and relationship issues, or managing depression and anxiety. No matter the issue, I believe that therapy can help most people deepen understanding by having a safe place to explore emotional experiences. I work with my clients to develop goals and priorities to make the most of our time together. \r\n\r\nI have experience and interest in the supporting people in the following areas:\r\n\r\n* Life transitions and adjustment\r\n* Relationship concerns\r\n* Anxiety\r\n* Depression\r\n* Parenting struggles\r\n* Chronic illness\r\n* Exploring family of origin \r\n* Attachment\r\n* Dealing with trauma\r\n* Managing stress\r\n* Identity exploration\r\n* Working with children and teenagers\r\n* Grief and loss\r\n* Recovery from oppressive or abusive religious experiences\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supporting Motherhood\r\n\r\nOne of my passions is supporting women through the emotional challenges of motherhood.
