<p>Therapy can be meaningful for people in many ways. Sometimes itâ€™s about finding support through life transitions, exploring family and relationship issues, or managing depression and anxiety. No matter the issue, I believe that therapy can help most people deepen understanding by having a safe place to explore emotional experiences. I work with my clients to develop goals and priorities to make the most of our time together. </p>

<p>I use a combination of approaches depending on the needs of my clients. However, I primarily draw from psychodynamic theory, client-centered therapy, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy. In my work with children, I primarily use non-directive experiential play therapy. If you have any questions about treatment modalities, I welcome this discussion in sessions.</p>

<p>Sessions are typically 45-50 min</p>

<p>I am a Clinical Social Worker who has been working in the field of helping people since 2001. Prior to attending graduate school, I worked extensively with youth and families, especially those experiencing poverty and homelessness. After graduate school, I worked for 5 years at an outpatient mental health clinic in south Minneapolis. There I worked with people of all ages and backgrounds with a variety of mental health needs. I also completed extra training in postpartum mental health issues, experiential play therapy, and adult attachment.</p>
