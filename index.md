> Therapy can be meaningful for people in many ways. Sometimes itâ€™s about finding support through life transitions, exploring family and relationship issues, or managing depression and anxiety. 

> No matter the issue, I believe that therapy can help most people deepen understanding by having a safe place to explore emotional experiences. I work with my clients to develop goals and priorities to make the most of our time together.


### I have experience and interest in supporting people in the following areas:

* Life transitions and adjustment
* Relationship concerns
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Parenting struggles
* Chronic illness
* Exploring family of origin 
* Attachment
* Dealing with trauma
* Managing stress
* Identity exploration
* Working with children and teenagers
* Grief and loss
* Recovery from oppressive or abusive religious experiences

### Supporting Motherhood

One of my passions is supporting women through the emotional challenges of motherhood. This could include: 

* Fertility struggles
* Overwhelming emotions during pregnancy
* Recovering from a traumatic birth experience
* NICU experiences and prematurity
* Adjusting to life with a new baby
* Postpartum depression and anxiety
* Miscarriage or infant loss

### Supervision

I offer clinical supervision for LGSWs working toward licensure. I love supporting people as they are gaining experience in this work.  My fee is $60 an hour. 

### Treatment Approaches

I use a combination of approaches depending on the needs of my clients. However, I primarily draw from psychodynamic theory, client-centered therapy, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy. In my work with children, I use non-directive experiential play therapy. If my clients have any questions about treatment modalities, I welcome this discussion in sessions.

Sessions are typically 45-50 minutes long. During the first session, I spend a lot of time gathering information to get an understanding my clients and the situation. It is typical that in subsequent sessions the flow is more organic and driven by client need.

I am a Clinical Social Worker who has been working in the field of helping people since 2001. Prior to attending graduate school, I worked extensively with youth and families, especially those experiencing poverty and homelessness. After graduate school, I worked for 5 years at an outpatient mental health clinic in south Minneapolis. There I worked with people of all ages and backgrounds with a variety of mental health needs. I also completed extra training in postpartum mental health issues, experiential play therapy, and adult attachment.
